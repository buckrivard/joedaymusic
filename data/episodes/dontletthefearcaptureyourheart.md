**I had always imagined the guest for _Don't Let The Fear Capture Your Heart_ should be the songwriter Sandra McCracken** because she strikes me as someone who lives in hope. Not the sanitized, rote clich√©, influencer wearing a HOPE T-shirt on an Instagram reel hope. The kind of hope born in the trenches of real life where shit gets messy and hard. Failure. Unmet expectations. Cancer. Divorce. A hope that can find light in those places.

_Don't Let The Fear_ is a song about looking for hope when it can't easily be found. I wrote it with my kids in mind, hoping that maybe the words _Hold onto the light, it ain't here yet, but the morning is nigh_ might find them in some future moment of need. But anytime you write a song for someone else, you also write it for yourself. Turns out, I needed this song as much as they did. I kinda thought Sandra would get that. I was so stoked when she agreed to have this conversation.

The day came, the call started, the video turned on, and there was Sandra McCracken in a HOPE t-shirt. What followed was not influencer wearing a HOPE t-shirt on an Instagram reel conversation, but ended up being one of the most memorable conversations I had with anyone in 2022. I'll just say this: listen to the episode. Sandra's the real deal.
