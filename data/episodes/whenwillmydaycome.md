**Tim Wilson doesn't always quote Def Leppard songs spontaneously**, but when he does, he does it with a seriousness and gravitas that transports statements like _I'm hot, sticky sweet, from my head to my feet. Yeah!_ into fodder for a serious discussion on the existential patience required while enduring the long everyday mundanities that occur between life's few mountain-top moments. It's true. He does it in this episode.

If you don't know Tim, he's the lead singer and songwriter in Seattle indie band [Ivan & Alyosha](http://www.ivanandalyosha.com/). We chat about I&A's new record, the many months of waiting, waiting, waiting that happen between when an album is written/recorded, and when it is released; how _When Will My Day Come_ might be the least rock & roll concept ever, and how living in the Halflight necessitates a sort of deeper waiting for all things to be made well.
