When my faith began to unravel, **Mike Cosper was one of the people I reached out to**. We'd known each other from afar for long enough that I knew he'd have both context and perspective that few people would have. And he did. What I didn't know at the time was that as I shared my story with him, it was during that conversation he begun to think "this story needs to be told" and started thinking about making a podcast about Mars Hill. Specifically the human impacts and effects on the lives of the people who were there. Crazy!

We chat about how I ditched church to write _Return My Heart to my Chest_, what he saw in the song that made him want to use it in the podcast, and Bruce Springsteen's writing process.

You can listen to the Rise and Fall of Mars Hill anywhere you get your podcasts.
