        "Brent James Driscoll is filmmaker and part of the team that creates and produces the Emmy-winning web series Sessions in Place. His story of how he grew up in a myriad of differing Christian expressions, and the events that pushed him out of the church, are important to hear - especially in light of his continued faith in Christ.\n\nIn this episode, you also get a glimpse into the evolution of the song itself. How it began as an angsty, post-punk/new wave song drawing on Dramarama and The Catherine Wheel and morphed into the more textural and imaginative song it became on the album.\n\nAs a bonus, weâ€™ve released the Fear & Love EP with all the demos and a brand new version that puts them all together. Go give it a listen today! ",
